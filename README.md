#### Test versions of schemas from the Beacon v2 development project

This repository contains test representations of schemas from the Beacon v2 development project. Schemas here are represented as separate files, in concordance with schema representations used by the [GA4GH Schemablocks {S}[B]](https://schemablocks.org/categories/schemas/) initiative.

Briefly, single schemas extracted from the Beacon v2 code base are deparsed into `JSON`, examples and Markdown documentation files as well as being equipped with metadata and processed into web pages utilizing the Jekyll / GitHub Pages system.

Tyhe representations here should be considered ephemeral and non-autoritive!

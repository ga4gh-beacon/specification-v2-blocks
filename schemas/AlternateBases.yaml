description: "The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Accepted \nvalues:\
  \ [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any \nbase, and can be\
  \ used as a standalone base of any type or within a \npartially known sequence.\
  \ For example a sequence where the first and \nlast bases are known, but the middle\
  \ portion can exhibit countless \nvariations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown:\
  \ ANNT the Ns can take \ntake any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT\
  \ (or any \nother combination) viable sequences.\nSymbolic ALT alleles (DEL, INS,\
  \ DUP, INV, CNV, DUP:TANDEM, DEL:ME,\nINS:ME) will be represented in `variantType`.\n\
  Optional: either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.\n"

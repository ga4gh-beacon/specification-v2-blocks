description: |
  Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`). 
  Accepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the 
  position of any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any 
  type or within a partially known sequence. For example a sequence 
  where the first and last bases are known, but the middle portion can 
  exhibit countless variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: 
  ANNT the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT 
  and ATGT (or any other combination) viable sequences.
type: string
pattern: ^([ACGTN]+)$
